This allows for greater privacy and control over personal information in digital environments."

DIDs are designed to give users control over their own identity and personal data, which means you decide when and with whom you share your DID and associated data."

Changing the keys periodically reduces the risk of the keys being compromised and used to access personal data or carry out unauthorized actions."

It then creates a file containing all this important information. You have control to decide where you want to save this file on your device. This feature provides you with a secure way to back up and transport your essential identity and cryptographic data for use on other devices or in recovery situations."

This includes the removal of data, DID, keys, verifiable credentials, settings, preferences, and any other modifications you have made. Please note that this action cannot be undone, so we recommend making a backup of your important information before proceeding."

Users can selectively share this information online, prove their identity, and maintain their privacy, all while having the portability to take their digital identity to different services and applications. This reduces the dependence on centralized intermediaries for identity management."
